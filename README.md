Okay, here are some things you should know about me

## I recently joined GitHub as a Senior Designer

## But I have no idea how to code

## So I'll be pretending to know how to build things 
While mostly relying on my incredible team. 

## But I AM good at design! 
So feel free to ask me any questions about that. 👍🏽 

## So hit me up if you want to collaborate on an initiative
I love new processes and bringing content, design, build and product together. 

## If you're because I broke something, then I'm sorry 😬  
We're both gonna need extra help if it's code related, but I got you if it's a design fix! 

# Extras
- 🦀 I'm a cancer. Be kind. 
- 🏡 I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio and like horrible things like Skyline Chili and the Bengals. And yes, I hate myself for it.
- 🍻 But i live in Chicago now which is my favorite place in the world! (except during the months of Nov – Apr)
- ✊🏽 I'm biracial and believe in equality for all. But on that same note, **Black Lives Matter** and please hire more women.
- 💬 I go by she/her/hers
