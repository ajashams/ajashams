- 🏡  I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio and like horrible things like Skyline Chili and the Bengals. And yes, I hate myself for it.
- 🍻  But i live in Chicago now which is my favorite place in the world! (except during the months of Nov – Apr)
- ✊🏽  I'm biracial and believe in equality for all. But on that same note, **Black Lives Matter** and please hire more women.
