Okay, here are some things you should know about me

## I recently joined GitHub as a Senior Designer

## But I have no idea how to code

## Which means I'll be pretending to know how to build things 
While mostly relying on my incredible team.

## But hit me up if you need design work or feedback on work!
I'm more than happy to help offer my skills, coaching and guidance wherever possible.

## And reach out if you'd like to collaborate on an initiative!
I love new processes and bringing content, design, technology and research together.

## If you're here because I broke something, then I'm sorry 😬  
We're both gonna need extra help if it's code related. but I got you if it's a design fix!
